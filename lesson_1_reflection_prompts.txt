files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Is very flexible save changes for multiples files, you can avoid the errors by forget make change in all files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log you can see all commits of your file, and with git diff you can see the differences of each pair that you selected

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I think that whit version control the changes become more efficient, and if you work in group only the colaborators can update and undertend the changes
